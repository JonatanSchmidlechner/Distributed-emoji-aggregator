# COMP.CS.510 Advanced Web Development: Back End - Group project work repository

This project is a distributed system. It contains a simple frontend, two servers from which the first one offers a REST API for communicating with the frontend, and the other uses a websocket to send real-time data to the frontend. Additionally there is a simple emoji generator that generates emojis. The emoji generator and the two servers communicate with apache kafka.

My contribution to the project was the backend excluding the emoji generator, which was provided by the course.
